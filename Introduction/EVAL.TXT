Help on built-in function eval in module builtins:

eval(source, globals=None, locals=None, /)
    Evaluate the given source in the context of globals and locals.
    
    The source may be a string representing a Python expression
    or a code object as returned by compile().
    The globals must be a dictionary and locals can be any mapping,
    defaulting to the current globals and locals.
    If only globals is given, locals defaults to it.
